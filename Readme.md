# Impedance Analyzer 

This programm does a linear frequency sweep from 'freq_start' to 'freq_end' with 'freq_delta' using the Digilent AD2 and the Impedance Adapter. The user interaction is performed using a GUI interface. It prints the numerical values of frequency [Hz], impedance [Ohm] and phase [deg] as a txt-file
